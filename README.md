# Winbooks On Web PHP Client

## Installation

```
composer require whitecube/winbooks-on-web-php-client
```

## Usage

```php
use Winbooks\Winbooks;

$winbooks = new Winbooks('oauth-token');
```

You can set the folder once and it will be used for all subsequent requests

```php
$winbooks->folder('TEST_FOLDER');

$winbooks->get(/*...*/)
```

To get all results from an object model, use the `all($object_model)` method.

```php
$winbooks->all('Customers');
```

To get a single result from an object model, use the `get($object_model, $code)` method.

```php
$winbooks->get('Customer', 'VLADIMIR');
```
